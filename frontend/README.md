Polarization of Light


1. Introduction to Light

Light is a type of electromagnetic energy that makes vision possible. It travels through space and through materials and has properties of both a wave and a particle. Interference, diffraction, and polarization are all manifestations of the wave nature of light; polarization, in particular, demonstrates that light waves are transverse.

2. Nature of Light Waves

Light is an electromagnetic wave that consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The fields are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The medium is not necessary for light to propagate, and it travels at a speed of approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s in vacuum. Due to its transverse nature, light can be polarized.

3. Definition of Polarization

Polarization involves the restriction of light-wave vibrations to a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In unpolarized light, the vibrations occur in all directions; but when these vibrations are confined in one plane, the resulting light is polarized. Polarization is therefore an additional proof that the light is transverse.

4. Unpolarized Light

Unpolarized light consists of the waves vibrating in all planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light from natural sources, as well as artificial ones, like the Sun and electric lamps, is unpolarized due to no fixed direction of vibration.

5. Polarized Light

Polarized light is light with its vibration confined to a single plane. Polarized light can be generated from unpolarized light simply by reflecting or absorbing. Polarized light is used for optical instruments, displays, and glare-reduction devices.

6. Polarization Types

Linear Polarization: The vibrations are made in one straight line or plane only.
Circular Polarization: The electric field traces a circle.

Polarization Types: - Elliptical Polarization: The electric field traces an ellipse; this represents the most general form of polarization.
7. Polarization Methods

Polarized light can be obtained from unpolarized light by the following mechanisms:

7.1 Polarization by Reflection

When unpolarized light falls on any transparent surface, the reflected component becomes partially or fully polarized under certain conditions.

7.2 Polarization by Refraction

Light passing through anisotropic crystals like calcite or quartz experiences double refraction in which two polarized emergent rays result.

7.3 Polarization by Scattering

Light scattered by atmospheric molecules obtains partial polarization, which provides the explanation for the blue colour of the sky and its polarised nature.

7.4 Polarization by Absorption

Certain materials absorb electric field vibrations preferentially in one orientation while transmitting vibrations in the orthogonal orientation. Polaroid devices operate on this principle.

8. Polarization by Reflection Brewster’s Law

When unpolarized light falls on a transparent surface with a certain angle of incidence, the reflected light gets completely polarised. The angle of incidence for which this happens is called the Brewster angle. tan θB = μ tan θB, where μ is the refractive index. Here, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular to each other.

9. Polaroid and Its Uses

A Polaroid is an artificial polarizing material that allows light vibrations to pass through in only one direction while suppressing the vibrations in the orthogonal direction.

Working principle:

- Absorbs vibrations along one orientation only.

- Transmits the vibrations perpendicular to the absorbed orientation.

Applications of Polaroids:
- Sunglasses to reduce glare.
Camera filters to enhance contrast.
LCD and LED display technologies.

- Optical instruments

- Stress analysis in engineering materials.

Polaroids are cost-effective, lightweight, and highly effective.
10. Applications of Polarization

- Photography
Displays with LCD and LED.

- Stress analysis

3-D cinema and virtual reality - Optical communication 

Conclusion 

Polarization is a fundamental property of light, confirming the transverse nature of it. It has extensive applications in science and engineering, also in everyday technology; hence, it enjoys a central place within wave optics.
